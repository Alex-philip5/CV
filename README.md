## How to Edit the template

```
1. Editing Content in the template

To edit the content open the corresponding *.html files and open them
in an editor such as VSCode or Notepad++.
Search for the content you want to change and edit it to the text you want.
Save the file and reopen the HTML file in the browser to see the changes.

2. Editing Styles of template

The main style is present in css\main.css which you can edit.
You must know how to edit CSS files to do this.
If you have purchased any of the premium versions then you will also get
SCSS source files which generate all the styles of the template.
You can use these SCSS files to make your changes and regenerate CSS.

3. Changing Images

You can change images inside the images\ folder.
Make sure to name the file the same as the original file.
If you wish to change the name of the image file then you must
also make a corresponding change in the HTML file which refer to that image.

## How to use the template
```
Upload the contents to your webserver.
index.html must be in the main (root) folder of your webserver.
Do not change the name of the template folders or files unless you know
what you are doing and are changing the names in HTML files too.
For Webhosting, you can go with https://templateflip.com/go/hosting for easy FTP file uploads (It's Mention for a public or FTP based Server, not GitHub Pages)
